### Cloud Storage
Any and all cloud storages you add to your Defiant account, extends available storage for you. The integrations to cloud storages are implemented in a fashion to offer a seemless experience for you.
To connect more than one cloud storage to your account, you need to upgrade to premium account. Upgrading grants you additional 15&nbsp;GB of Defiant cloud storage.
Currently the following cloud storages are available for you to connect to your Defiant account.

We have selected these cloud storages because of the maturity of their API's and SDK's. Our conclusion is that Microsoft OneDrive does not meet the maturity criteria (yet) as of December 2020, hence it is excluded.
